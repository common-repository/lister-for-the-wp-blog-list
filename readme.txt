== Description ==

The WP Blog List (wpbl.org) is a website directory and blog aggregator that aims to find, organize and make accessible the world's WordPress websites. We will provide our visitors with ways to find new and interesting blogs, services and shops. Listing is totally free. The list is human curated and all websites are checked before appearing.

wpbl.org will only take publicly available data from your website, it will store your blogs URL, Site Name and Tagline.

Inclusion is fully automatic, simply activate the plugin and your blog will be included. To be removed from our list (and delete all your data) deactivate the plugin. Fast and easy. New additions can take 24-48 hours to be checked and included.
